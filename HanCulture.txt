1.Language:     Han Chinese speak various forms of the Chinese language that are descended from a common early language; one of the names of the language groups is Hanyu, literally the "Han language". Similarly, Chinese characters, used to write the language, are called Hanzi, or "Han characters".2.Dress:    Both the Kimono from Japan and the Hanbok in Korea were influenced by the Han Chinese clothing. The Vietnamese Ao dai bears similarities with the Chinese Cheongsam but ultimately descends from the ao to than, which was influenced by the fashion of China's imperial court. In Vietnam, the court attire or royal clothing worn by the Nguyen dynasty descended from Ming clothing with some influence from the Qing dynasty. However, the most popular one-piece traditional Chinese clothing worn by many women on important occasions such as wedding banquets and New Year celebrations is qipao, created in the 1920s in Shanghai.
